# Sending a poll
In this guide, you will learn how to send a poll.

## 1. Create a command
The first step is to create a new command, which you can learn to do in [this guide](../Guide/1.create.md).

## 2. Set a trigger
Let assume user need to say `!poll` to send the poll

## 3. Craft the code

Now that we have the initial setup done, it's time to make the command actually work.

::: tip We will use:
* [$sendMessage](../Message/sendMessage.md) - to send a message
* [poll curl data](../CodeReferences/ref.poll_data.md)
:::

### Sending a message
To send a message, we will use `$sendMessage[content]` where content is the message content, in our case we will fill it with our poll data

### Constructing the poll
we will use [poll curl data](../CodeReferences/ref.poll_data.md) like:
```
{poll:
	{question=poll question}
	{duration=poll duration in hours like 24h}
	{multiple=can user select multiple answers? (yes/no)}
	
	{answer=Add an anwer}
	{emoji=Add an emoji to the previous answer}
	
	{answer=Add an anwer}
	{emoji=Add an emoji to the previous answer}
	...
}
```

In our case, we will send a poll about countries code:
```
$sendMessage[
{poll:
{question=What is the biggest country in the world?}
{answer=China}
{emoji=ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³} 
{answer=Russia}
{emoji=ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º}

{duration=1h}
{multiple=no}
}
]
```

### Final result

::: tip Note
You may not always limit executions to one per user, you can use other vars like `server vars` to restrict the command to one execution per server.

### ðŸŽ‰ Congrats!
You've learned how to make a command that can be used only one time!
